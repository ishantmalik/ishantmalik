Suppose you have deployed your application using a deployment controller. Assume the initial number of replicas is one. Write the steps needed to update a container's image using deployment, making sure that there is zero downtime.
Answer:
Kindly Update the image name in the deployment manifest.
Run the below command to update the deployment
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
it will create new pods with the new image and then  replace the old pods with the new ones.
update complete 
all of the pods will be running the new image.
Example of a deployment manifest:
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment 
metadata: 
name: my-app 
spec: 
  replicas: 1 
selector: 
  matchLabels: 
  app: my-app 
 template: 
   metadata: 
 labels: 
   app: my-app 
  spec: 
    containers: 
    - name: my-app 
      image: my-app:latest

The deployment is named my-app and it has a single replica. 
The container in the pod is named my-app and it has the image my-app:latest.
To update the image, you would simply change the image name in the deployment manifest to the new image name.
For example, to update the image to my-app:1.2.3, you would change the line in the manifest that says image: my-app:latest to image: my-app:1.2.3.
